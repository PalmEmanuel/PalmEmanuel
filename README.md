### Hello there! <âš¡>

I'm an IT viking who loves Azure and .NET, always interested in learning something new. When I'm not writing code or exploring serverless tech I enjoy slaying virtual dragons with my friends.

I write potentially educational things about my endeavours in tech on [my blog PipeHow](https://www.pipehow.tech/).
